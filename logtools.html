        Wrote log file: [...]/2018-06-19~10:03:26~AE857318-73E2-11E8-B001-C21D2A288BEE~8910.jsonl

        The event log is a jsonl file containing every event the harness saw.
        <p>

        The log can be output in a compressed form using gzip or bzip2 (-G or -B flags)
        <p>

        The event log is a lossless format that will let you completely replay a test run (or parts of it) without actually re-running your tests.
        <p>

        The event log has Test2 events, with all their context data, in most cases there was no TAP conversion involved.
        <p>

        stdout/stderr exit codes, and all other data the harness collects are placed into events in the log.
        <p>

        There are several tools to process logs and provide useful metrics or summarize results.
        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Longest running tests</li>
            <li>How much time is spent in startup, teardown, runtime, etc.</li>
            <li>UI tool to view events in a web interface</li>
        </ul>
