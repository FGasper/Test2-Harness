        <h2>Default Output</h2>

        The default output provided by yath is intended for humans, not parsers.
        <p>

        The rules are similar to prove's, passing test gets one line, diagnostics messages and failed tests are still printed.
        <p>

        Yath output includes the job the output came from, useful when things run concurrently.

        Quiet mode has no output, just a true or false exit code.

        <h2>Verbose Mode</h2>

        All output, all the time.

    <dd>
        <h2>QVF (Quiet, but verbose on failure)</h2>

        Passing tests only show a passing line, no diag messages or STDERR.
        <p>
        Failing tests are completely verbose.
        <p>
        Output is buffered until the test file is complete, so no muxing.

        <h2>Renderers</h2>
        <p>

        You can write your own renderers for yath to completely control the output.
        <p>

        The default renderer is called Test2::Harness::Renderer::Formatter, which lets you use any Test2 formatter as your output.
        <p>

        Writing a custom renderer is intended to be simple/trivial, but in practice there is still some work to do on that.
        <p>

        Renderers being worked on by someone somewhere (not me):
        <ul>
            <li>JUnit XML</li>
            <li>Team City</li>
        </ul>
